# Assignment Portfolio
by Waicong Charles Tam

## Introduction
Hi! I'm Waicong Tam (Charles), a current Master of Information Technology student in Monash University. This is a repository that works as my personal portfolio. I will update the assignment that I consider worth showcasing here. Usually I will upload the assignment after it had been graded and I had organised it well.

## What are the units (subjects) that have been uploaded?
### FIT9131 - Programming foundations in Java
This is a unit I took when I was in my first semester here. I achieved semester top in this unit, and I have so much enthusiasm in this unit! Hopefully I had made progress and improvement from the first assignment to the other! This is a unit about basic programming skills and principles in Java.
The first assignment is a chess game, the other one is a Grand Prix simulator. Personally I love the second one so much since I am a huge Formula One fan!
### FIT5202 - Data processing for big data
This unit is about processing data using Apache Spark and the basics of different machine learning algorithms. It is one of my favourite units.
#### Assignment 1
The first assignment is about wrangling and explanatory analysis on data, it is composed of two parts. <br>
Part A is about analysis of the words in two books. I discovered the numeric distribution and compare the top words of the two books.<br>
Part B is about the analysis of the crime records in the state of South Australia. Data wrangling and visualisation techniques are implememnted in this part. I analysed crimes in different suburbs, in different years and in other aspects.
## Hope you enjoy it!
