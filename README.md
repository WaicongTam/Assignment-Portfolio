# Assignment Portfolio
by Waicong Charles Tam

## Introduction
Hi! I'm Waicong Tam (Charles), a current Master of Information Technology student in Monash University. This is a repository that works as my personal portfolio. I will update the assignment that I consider worth showcasing here. Usually I will upload the assignment after it had been graded and I had organised it well.

## What are the units (subjects) that has been uploaded?
### FIT9131 - Programming foundations in Java
This is a unit I took when I was in my first semester here. I achieved semester top in this unit, and I have so much enthusiasm in this unit! Hopefully I had made progress and improvement from the first assignment to the other!
The first assignment is about a chess game, the other one is a Grand Prix simulator. Personally I love the second one so much!
### FIT5202 - Data processing for big data
This unit is about processing data. The first assignment is about wrangling and explanatory analysis on data.

## Hope you enjoy it!
